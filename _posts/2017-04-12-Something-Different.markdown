My last posts have taken a close look at what is our place as a species. But what is the point of using an online blog
if all my ideas are going to be articulated as text? I recently got my hands on a nice camera, so lets be a little more
colorful in our approach today. 

Our last homework assignment for the semester is to, "take a few deep breaths, stand in sunshine for a moment of two, and remind yourself of the things that make you laugh". If this isn't an expression of what a person should aim to do every day, I don't know what is. I've been trying to drive home the idea that people are here to accomplish all that they are capable of, to try their hardest. And that this does involve a good degree of sacrifice. This will be the post where I qualify this statement by also saying that life is meant to be enjoyed. In other words, hard work and enjoyment can go hand in hand. Nobody playing Frisbee on tech green is going to go on to play Frisbee professionally, but people who do play are enjoying the company of one another. They are cooperating to achieve more enjoyment than they could have alone.

Below is a picture I took at the library. I try to pick up books that have nothing to do with my classes or work. These books may not directly make be better at what I do but it is good to appreciate the work that others have put into their trade. Further, imagining fantastic fictitious worlds serves as a source of inspiration to me. Working day and night on one thing is, if nothing else, inefficient. It staves off creativity by preventing one from seeing things in a new light.

I have said many times that self-cultivation involves "honing ones craft".  I never specified what ones drive(s) should be. Selecting what to dedicate oneself is a deeply personal decision. But a simple rule of thumb is to do things that are generally as enjoyable to you as Frisbee is to kids on tech green. There will be ups and downs in the field, but it should still be something one finds engaging. For me that's is robotics. Here's a picture of my lab, when I'm told to go to "my happy place", this may very well be it. This is my place and in the next article I look forward to discussing how I might know this.
