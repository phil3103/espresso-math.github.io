In my last post, I made the statement that our place in the world consists of our duty to ourselves
and to others. So in this post I will elaborate on the first part of that statement by exploring
what our duty to ourselves really is. With that introduction, let's jump right in!  

Renowned French physiologist Alexis Carrell tells us that, "man cannot remake himself without suffering, for he is both the marble and the sculptor". This is the idea behind self-cultivation. When one invests in something, they are losing capital know in the hope of a return on that investment. When a human tries to improve themselves, they are sacrificing comfort for an increase in their quality of life. The reason I argue that our place on Earth is in part defined by improving ourselves is that our time here on earth is finite. As a result, going cradle to grave without exploring the facets of life that are available to you is a tragedy. 

I want to note that when I talk about improving oneself, there are multiple routes there can be taken. Obviously, an athlete is improving themselves when they workout, but a scholar is improving themselves when they read and any normal person is improving themselves when they try to hone their skills. In short, there is no "most improved human", rather our place in the world involves finding a route of improvements that fits the interests of each unique person. 

Earlier in class, I learned about the different views of identity philosophers held. One of the popular points of view was the theory of "narrative identity". That is, people find meaning by looking at their story as a whole and draw purpose from this continuity. This theory affirms the need for self-improvement as one's narrative should have some sort of direction. 

Having addressed the best cases of self-cultivation, it's now time to come crashing back to reality. I can't spend all day studying or training, no matter how much I'd want to. When a man or woman tries to better themselves, they have to account that plans inevitably have to be adjusted and 100% efficiency is impossible. Just writing out this post made me think about ways to optimize my time so I could spend more of it learning.  

We should also address those who decide to try to worsen life for other rather than improve our own. Philosophers like Leibniz had quite a battle trying to justify the existence of evil in the same universe as an omnipotent, benevolent, omniscient God. My job is a little easier. I will simply assert that those who dedicate themselves to evil are refuting their place on Earth. This could be result of their nature or their environment, but either way those people should be pitied.  

To sum up, our place hear on Earth is to become the best version of ourselves. Striving to be better than others is a waste of effort, but trying to improve yourself in the short time we have on Earth is what we as a species are here to do.
