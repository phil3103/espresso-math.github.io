Over the course of the next month, I will be writing a series of web articles trying to tackle the question
"What is our place in the world and how do we know it?" This is a challenging question, so I'll do what
any computer scientist, and any deep thinker would do when confronted with a large question. I'll break the 
problem into parts and work on each smaller problem. My goal for this article is to do just that. We want 
to try and parse the question in a way that it can be explored in the depth it deserves. The further benefit to
breaking down the question we have to answer is our answers to the smaller "sub-questions" can be built
on the shoulders of the philosophical giants before us. So with that said, let's begin.
