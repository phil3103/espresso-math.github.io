So far I have defined what our place on Earth is. I'm sure many of my peers came up with different solutions, but are we all correct? How can I assert so confidently
that my view of our place is accurate? In other words, how do we know our place? Well, that's the point of these next two posts. In this one I'll look at the first part
of that question by wondering, how can we know anything? In the next I will look at how our newfound appreciation of knowledge can be directly applied to the question,
what is our place in the world.   

I'll start with a bold claim. We can never really know most things. Take a look at Descartes's thought experiment. We could all just be brains in a jar being fed sensory
input designed to make us feel that we are experiencing the things we are. Descartes realization that we know that we are a thinking entity is useful, but his argument
to build this realization up further is fairly weak and makes assumptions about the nature of God.  So how do we approach Truth? 

Well there are things we know to be true analytically. That is, they are true by definition. The Philosophers David Hume and Immanuel Kant called knowledge obtained this
way as Matters of Fact and analytic propositions respectively. Hume outlined his ideas in his _Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_ and Kant did it in his 
_Critique of Pure Reason_. Hume, the empiricist, believed that we could only know things that we derived analytically and that using past evidence to justify an
argument was a logical fallacy. Simply put, his argument says that just become something happened one way for all of time so far does not guarantee it will happen that way
in the future. To put this in fancier terms:

\begin{align}
    x \rightarrow y 
\end{align}
at time a time t
\begin{align}
t = t_0
\end{align}
does not imply
\begin{align}
x \rightarrow y \forall t
\end{align}

(If it's not already evident, I think formal logic is really cool. 
I wish I knew more). 
Kant, a type of radical empiricist, tries to put forward that some experimental evidence is a valid basis for assumption. Nonetheless, what the ideals that these two set forward should make it clear that
to assert what we take for granted is true without significant thought. Going back to Descartes, we some general guidelines for building a base of knowledge to make
decisions off of. It is the basis that I used to sketch out my theory of existence. This is the idea I will elaborate on more in my next post.
