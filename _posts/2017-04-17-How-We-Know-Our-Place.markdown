As we near the end of my little series, it's time to start asking some of the harder questions. (As if questioning whether we're not brains
in a jar wasn't hard enough). It's all well and good for me to assert that our place on Earth is to cultivate ourselves and work with others
to become the very best we can become. But as I just demonstrated, knowledge is fickle, so how do we know our place on Earth?

The type of knowledge that lead me to make the assertion that I've made was what Immanuel Kant would call Synthethic a priori. While analytical propositions 
are more airtight as they don't involve any experience, they don't allow you to derive truly novel ideas. This Synthethic a priori knowledge is
built on experience but is not dependent on experience. Simply put, we feel most accomplished not after a day of lounging around or indulging
ourselves, but after a day of doing meaningful and productive work. Even if that productive work was spending valuable time with friends in 
a reasonable amount it still fills us with satisfaction. All of our lives are finite, so it is the goal to maximize the amount of good feelings
we have in the time that we are here. The way to maximize these good feelings is to sacrifice small doses of content in the short term
for large hits of pride in the long term. This fact is one that is verifiable without prior experience. 

To Kant, because my argument is Synthethic a priori, it is reasonable to take it as truth. Note, that I said truth with a lower-case t. 
I did not derive my argument from logical necessities alone, and as a such there it would be ambitious to call it the Truth. Furthermore,
I should acknowledge the work of my peers. No doubt they arrived at different conclusions than I did, and it would be a mistake to call their
answers "wrong" and my answer "right". As ethical systems often work, different rule codes can produce the same action. Similarly, I think
fulfilling what I think our place on Earth is can result in the same actions as following the placements of Humanity that others prescribe. 
To be frank, this is OK. Intent is important, but only second do the action actually done.
