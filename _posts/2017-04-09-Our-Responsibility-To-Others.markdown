Over the course of the next month, I will be writing a series of web articles trying to tackle the question
"What is our place in the world and how do we know it?" This is a challenging question, so I'll do what
any computer scientist, and any deep thinker would do when confronted with a large question. I'll break the 
problem into parts and work on each smaller problem. My goal for this article is to start this process. We want 
to try and parse the question in a way that it can be explored in the depth it deserves. The further benefit to
breaking down the question we have is that our answers to the smaller "sub-questions" can be built
on the shoulders of the philosophical giants before us. After exploring what the question given entails, we will
begin to formulate an answer which will be flushed out in future posts. With that said, let's begin.   
   
The question that needs to be answered consists of identifying humans' place in the world
and studying the limits of knowledge with respect to our place in the world. The question that follows naturally
from the first task is what do we mean by "our place". Without a clear definition of what our place in the world
means, we can't have a meaningful discussion about what our place is. For the purpose of this project, we can 
define "humanity's place in the world" as "what is our collective responsibility to ourselves, each other, and 
the planet on which we reside". I will argue that our place in the world has multiple components. Humans are here
to cultivate themselves and work together and produce "amazing" things. The definition of "amazing" here is vague, but
the point is that humans are utilizing themselves to the fullest to cooperate. In short, our place in the world
is to recognize our potential. A prerequisite to cooperation is peace, and so humans must endeavor to avoid
what Thomas Hobbes referred to as a "natural state of war".    

Having answered the question "what is our place in the world?", the next step is to study how we know this place
in the world. Our line of logic will likely shadow that of Descartes when he proved his existence by asserting
that he was a thinking entity. Our place in the world is whatever we define it to be. As a result, we know that our
place in the world is to create things together because this is what defines us collectively. In considering this question
it is also important to distinguish humans from other things. This is done by looking at humans as beings with senses that
illuminate a world that might not exist outside of what we can perceive.  

Now that we have established preliminary ideas, and know where the rest of this argument will take us, we can
begin to add details and context to our argument.
