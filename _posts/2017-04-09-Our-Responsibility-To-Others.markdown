Having discussed how important it is to  maintain a healthy relationship with oneself, it is now time to look at how we interact with others. A life of solitude is not the optimal way to self-improve as we grow through our interactions with others. Philosopher Thomas Hobbes described life without governance as, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short". While his standards for how free humans behave may be low, he is right in that life improves drastically when humans bond together. At a coarse level like what Hobbes and John Locke discussed, humans organize by forming government. But at a higher level, humans can work together to build and compose things together. An individual who works to improve themselves can create great things, but a team of such individuals can do even more.  

Before explaining why people can do so much together, we should look at the dark side of organization: manipulation. Specifically, why the ideals of Niccolo Machiavelli, while useful, should not embraced by people. To Machiavelli, the sovereign should strive to take advantage of his people to accomplish his own ends. Machiavelli even says, "there is nothing more formidable than a multitude loose and without a Head, and on the other hand, there is nothing weaker" in *Discourses*. To him, this multitude is something to be controlled. Although we (unfortunately), didn't get to Friedrich Nietzsche in class, his outlook was not dissimilar. Nietzsche's "Ubermensch" was fit to impose his will on the weaker masses.  

People who embrace the ideas of Nietzsche and Machiavelli are ignoring what our place on earth really is. This type of abuse only breeds distrust and leads to suboptimal results in the long term. Innovation such as the booms witnessed in the age of innovation and during the rennaisance were the results of open cooperation, not some master architect bending others to his will.  One person can only do so much, and that amount will always be lower than a group of equally hard working people. Philosophers like Hobbe and Locke argue that by commiting oneself to a group results in sacrificing liberty. But as we say in my last post, this sacrifice is an investment in the hope of a return. By giving up full liberty to do as one desires, one commits to a group of people, maximizing the potential for a fruitful alliance.

Asking what is our place is a question with many ramifications. In my last two posts I have argued that our place is to realize our potential, and that this is realized by cultivating ourselves and working with others. It is clear that by using our short time well, and allowing for distractions, we can fully take advantage of all that life has to offer. Although this may require the sacrifice of comfort and liberty, in the long term it returns progress that future generations can then live on.
